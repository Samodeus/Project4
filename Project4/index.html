<p>Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, from applications to storage
and processing power. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and
economies of scale. Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows
companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that
cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved
manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust
resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing the burst computing
capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.

<div class="intro" >
    <p> Hello my name is Miguelangel. I am a Senior at lehman college majoring in CIS(Computer Information systems)
    Im currently taking <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/sfulakeza/">CMP 128</a>, I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS 
    from a class in lehman CIS 228. I also have experience in MYSQL from another course I took recently, I was never really a coder but the classes I have just mentioned
    have changed all that and now see coding as fun and intresting. I am very proficient in hardware and general IT since my Highschool had offered IT as a course.</p>
 <img src="img/me.jpg">
    <p> I hope from this course I am able to learn more about HTML and CSS, I took this course as fluff to fill up my schedule
    but was excited to hear that it course was teaching HTML and CSS. I dont see myself becoming a coder in the future, as a job that would be perfect for me will be
    one where I help people fix general computer problems like that at an IT help desk. Although I don't really see myself diving more into the field of coding, the more and more I do learn about HTML, CSS or even MYSQL the more I think is fun and well worth it to perhaps seek a job in the field.
    Another perfect job for me would be building computers or fixing them, I am really good with hardware and find it exciting tinkering with the inside of a PC.
